Hello 

You can no longer login to Skype via Facebook as of January 2018. All Skype logins have been streamlined to Microsoft accounts, allowing you to login with a single sign-in, unlocking all your Microsoft services – including Skype, Office Online, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, and more – in one experience, with just one password. To continue using Skype, either create a new Microsoft account or sign in with an existing Microsoft account if you already have one.
Do you have an email address that you use to sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Xbox, Office Online, OneDrive, Outlook.com, or Windows?
Yes. Great - that same email can be used to sign in to Skype!

No. No problem, go to our Create an account page and we'll walk you through creating a new Microsoft account that you can use to sign in to Skype and other Microsoft services.
